# Air-Traffic-Control---Kruskal-Dijkstra-DAA-
The project, “Air Traffic Control System using Kruskal’s and Dijkstra’s Algorithms,” is a Python-based software solution that demonstrates the use of two classical graph algorithms Kruskal’s Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm and Dijkstra’s Shortest Path Algorithm for efficient route optimization in an air traffic control network.
